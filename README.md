# social-distance-detection-using-computer-vision-and-openvino
This project detects the social distance in public, and if the distance between the people is less than the threshold distance, it shows the number of violations in that frame of a video. In this project, there is a comparison between the optimised version that used the Intel OpenVINO toolkit and the unoptimized version without using OpenVINO.
